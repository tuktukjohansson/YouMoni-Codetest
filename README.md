Welcome to My Weather App! 🌦️

Hey there, YouMoni Team! 😄

This is my simple weather app, built with Expo and React Native.

Screens:

1. CurrentTemp
   Here you can see the current temperature for your location and a short description of the weather. (Make sure to give the app permission to access your location!)

2. Forecast
   Check out the Horizontal Scrollview where you can view the weather forecast for the next 5 days. Perfect for planning ahead! ☀️🌧️

Add the API key I sent via email into utils/weatherAPI.ts -> API_KEY
